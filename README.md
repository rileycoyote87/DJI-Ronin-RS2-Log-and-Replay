# DJI Ronin RS2/3 Pro - Log and Replay Movements
based on the Ronin SDK this simple two script python set reads and logs gimbal yaw, roll, pitch, and focus motor position, and then will replay the movement based on the log. Used as a cinematography and vfx motion control tool.

Made in collaboration and consultation by [Cornelius von Einem](https://github.com/ceinem), Casey Basichis, [Riley Harmon](https://rileyharmon.com), and DJI Engineers 

based on [dji_rs2_ros_controller](https://github.com/ceinem/dji_rs2_ros_controller) and the [R SDK Demo Software](https://terra-1-g.djicdn.com/851d20f7b9f64838a34cd02351370894/DJI%20R%20SDK/SDK%20demo%20software.zip).

Python3 using Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa

```
save the .bashrc file and either re-initalize it or close the terminal and open a new terminal window


4) run `sudo can-up`  in terminal to initialize the can device (you'll need to edit this file depending on your type of can device interface)
5) run `ronin-record` in terminal to record the movements to the log
